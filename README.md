![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/andretran/DesktopDefense/master/DesktopDefenseScreenshot.png)

Project Information
-------------------
This is a re-creation of a tower defense game known as "Desktop Defense" (written in Java).

I made this program as my final project for a CS class I took in grade 12.

There were many challanges for this project including how to implement A* pathfinding as well as adding AI for the different enemy units and towers (including both ground and flying units).

Game Objective
--------------
Try to achieve the highest score by building defense towers in order to prevent the enemy units from reaching the end of your desktop.

Starting Game
-------------
- Open Command Prompt
- Go into the "DesktopDefense" directory
- Run the following command "java DTDMain"

Controls
--------
- Pause - pause your game
- Upgrade - upgrade your towers by clicking on them
- Sell - sell your towers for half their original price
